# budget-tracker
For this app, I was provided with some starter code, and was asked to build a budget tracker that was able to serve as a progressive web application. Much of the base app came pre-built, and the bulk of my task was converting the app into a PWA. 

# starter code
The following files were provided as starter code:
/models/transaction.js
/public/icons (all)
/public/index.html
/public/index.js
/public/styles.css
/routes.api.js
package.json
server.js

The following changes were made to the starter code
/public/index.html
    added a link to /public/manifest.webmanifest

# dependencies
This app is built with compression, express, lite-server, mongoose, and morgan.
